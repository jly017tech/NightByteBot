<h1>NightByteBot</h1>
<p>Hello, there</p>

<p>
  I made a chatbot with tkinter and tkkboostrap. 
  I added two labels, one textbox scroll area, one button, and one entry box.
  My plan is to implement menu button and it will calculate, shows the graph, and gets from the chatgpt input.
  After getting the information, the another window opens and it shows the graph.
